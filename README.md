SOTE (Static Only Templating Engine) Is a tool to help you build simple HTML sites with some of the bonuses of modern JavaScript frameworks.

There is now a documentation website! Check it out [here](https://docs.sote-framework.tech/)!

# Why

I love modern JavaScript frameworks. I use them all the time and will continue to use them all the time. What I wanted was to get some of the benefit of the component syntax and the way that data as passed down the page but with a much simpler boilerplate and setup for simple applications. I imagine this being used for simple static sites and basic interaction.

This tool is not a replacement for the more advanced frameworks (React, VueJS, Angular, etc). It will never provide the flexibility and power that they offer.
